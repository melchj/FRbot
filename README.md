# FRbot
 
have it running on a raspberry pi.

requires a ".env" file in root directory that contains the bot token (TOKEN=xxxxxxxx).

also good to set up cron to start the python script on reboot of the rpi, and without the ssh active.

dependancies include:
- python
- discord.py package
- python-dotenv package
- perhaps other things that i'm forgetting...
